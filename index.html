                    <p>I am a Software Engineering Student at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec.
                        I am in the second year of my studies and looking for an <strong>internship in the Summer of 2020</strong>
                        to further develop my knowledge in the field. I currently have completed the Introduction to 
                        Object-Oriented Programming where I learned a lot about <strong>Java</strong>, Web Development where I learned about 
                        <strong>HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP</strong>. I have also learned some <strong>C++ and Python</strong> in my free time and I have 
                        created a few applications that are on my GitHub.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        By the time I would start working for said internship I will have completed important classes that are either underway or going to be taken
                        in the winter. The most important being <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms and Operating Systems</strong>. I am currently working and intend
                        to start new projects to develop my skills independantly and learn new languages and concepts. Most recently, I made a chess game from scratch using Java,
                        with a fully implemented GUI and learned many different concepts like how Immutable Lists work and when they should be used.

                                Created the game from scratch and implemented a fully working GUI with a working chess engine.<br>
                                Learned a lot about hashing and immutability of lists and how to use them.<br>
                                <br>
                                How It Works<br>
                                Everytime a player selects a piece, it displays all the different possible positions the piece can be moved taking into consideration
                                all the restrictions such as, if the move you are trying to make puts you in check or if their is a piece in the way. Implemented using
                                Java GUI code and all my code is available at <a href="https://github.com/bowe99/Chess-Game" target="_blank">this GitHub link.</a><br>
                                <br> 
                                The video on the right is a demo of the features built in and some gameplay of the game. All the moves are being stored on the right column
                                and the taken pieces are stored and displayed in the left column.

                                    Created a small applet that displays to-do list items that need to be done using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    How It Works<br>
                                    First of all, I coded the input bar to always be in focus therefore, whoever is using the list does not need to click 
                                    the input bar and there is also an event listener on the submit button that allows the user to press the return key 
                                    and have the to-do item posted in the list. There are two things that can be done with an item, either recycle it(or delete) 
                                    or mark it as done. If it is marked as done it will be moved to another list below the to-do list with all the completed tasks.
