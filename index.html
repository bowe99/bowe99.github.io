                                The purpose of this application was to create an app to help people recycle, reuse and
                                reduce their containers and products.
                                The main goal was to provide people with the tools to effectively reduce the amount of
                                waste they produce.

                                <strong>How It Works</strong><br>
                                We used the Flutter framework to design the UI and the Firebase platform for the backend
                                of the application. Also using Google's Machine Learning Vision API to detect the
                                objects or barcodes.<br>
                                <br>
                                The user is able to scan a product or a barcode. The barcode will automatically bring
                                you to a product page while the scanning of a product will return categories from the ML
                                vision API and it will search through our database for items with the same categories.
                                For example, if you were to scan a Coca-Cola can the ML vision would recognize the can
                                as a beverage can and would search through the database to find all items with that
                                category.<br>
                                <br>
                                Once you found your product, the user will be presented with 4 different possible
                                screens. First, a dashboard with more information about the product that was scanned.
                                The second tab displays information on how to recycle the packaging of the item or the
                                item itself. The third screen will be a list of DIY projects that can be done using the
                                item. Finally, the last screen will present a list of products that are similar to the
                                item but use less materials. For example, a bottle of shampoo will have links to bar
                                shampoos that completely get rid of the plastic bottle all together.<br>

                            The purpose of this application was to learn how to use databases and how to connect them to
                            an application. This application also served as an experiment to learn about providers and how
                            to use and transfer information in different parts of the application. This app also implements 
                            user authentification and animation of widgets. This app was built with the help of a Udemy 
                            course created by Max Schwarzm√ºller.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>How It Works</strong><br>
                            I used the Flutter framework to design the UI and the Firebase platform for the backend
                            of the application. <br>
                            <br>
                            The first part of the building of this application was the use of Providers. This was a way 
                            to share information throughout the entire application without having to pass information through
                            the constructors of the widgets. This also removes the need for most stateful widgets as the Providers 
                            rebuild application based on when information changes. <br>
                            <br>
                            The second part was using forms and user input. This includes input verification and using the data 
                            submited to create new objects in the application. For this app we used forms for the addition of user
                            products to be added to the shop.<br>
                            <br>
                            The next part consists of connecting the information from the app to a database. This application uses
                            the Firebase real-time database and it stores the product information as well as the order information.<br>
                            <br>
                            I then implemented user authentification with Firebase. This includes auto-login where if the application 
                            closes it will try and find an active login token and will automatically sign-in. We also modified the database
                            to return user specific products. Meaning in the editting screen users can only delete and edit their own
                            products.<br>
                            <br>
                            Finally, animations were added to some of the components of the application to make transitions feel more
                            fluid and to add to user experience.<br>

                        In a terminal a user can select the number of items that are going to be sorted and the sorting

                        and randomized. They are then displayed by rectangles with heights represented by their values
                        the sorting is then displayed while updating the graph for every operation needed. <br>

                        The purpose of this application was to create a platform for people to find activities to do
                        during their school breaks.
                        The main idea was for users to be able to connect with other people using the app and being
                        able to find common breaks between
                        them. Then we would recommend different activities based on the time and weather that are
                        nearby. For example,
                        if it was near lunchtime, the app would display your next break with people that have breaks
                        at the same time and
                        recommend nearby restaurants to go to while on break.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How It Works</strong><br>
                        We used the Flutter framework to design the UI and the Firebase platform for the backend of
                        the application.
                        The user is able to connect to their account and add classes to their schedule. Once the
                        class is added it is stored in the Firestore
                        database. The data is retreived everytime the user logs in to their account.
                        Adding a class is as simple as clicking the floating button at the bottom of the screen and
                        filling out the data.
                        Once added the class will be displayed on the schedule. The app the finds when your next
                        break is going to be
                        and displays it under the schedule. Followed by the recommendations of activities. We were
                        unable to implement the connection
                        between people in the 24 hour challenge but our team is planning to finish the app for a

                        This app allows a user to look at differnet types of recipes while also filtering to suit
                        vegetarian, vegan, lactose and gluten restrictions. While also allowing the user to keep track
                        of favorite recipes.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How It Works</strong><br>
                        All recipes are split into categories where each recipe can have multiple categories.<br>
                        <br>
                        Once a category is selected it will go to a different screen with a list of different meals also
                        allowing the user to select a recipe to be brought to a description of the meal with the recipe
                        ingredients and the steps to complete the recipe. The user can then select the recipe to be
                        stored as a favorit or unmark a recipe that has already been favorited.<br>
                        <br>
                        The user can also use the menu tab on the initial screen to go and set filters on the recipes
                        that should be displayed. Such as vegeterian, vegan, lactose free and gluten free meals.<br>

                        This app allows a user to track his personal expenses by keeping a log of all the expenses
                        that have been made. It also displays a chart with spending from the last 7 days and displays
                        which
                        day of that week was the most expensive.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How It Works</strong><br>
                        The chart takes in all the transactions in the past 7 days and displays a colored bar over each
                        day
                        where the height is calculated as a percentage of all transactions for that specific date and is
                        compared to the
                        past weeks transactions.<br>
                        <br>

                        The list at the bottom is a simple infinite list that displays all the transactions that have
                        been made.<br>
                        <br>
                        The app also is responsive when it comes to orientation, OS and Screen Size. If the phone is set
                        to landscape,
                        it will give the user the choice to either see the chart or the transaction list. If the phone
                        is an Iphone it will use Cupertino styled Widgets
                        and finally, the widgets are sized according to the screen size of any device.<br>

                        Created a small applet that displays to-do list items that need to be done using HTML, CSS
                        and JavaScript.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How It Works</strong><br>
                        First of all, I coded the input bar to always be in focus therefore, whoever is using the
                        list does not need to click
                        the input bar and there is also an event listener on the submit button that allows the user
                        to press the return key
                        and have the to-do item posted in the list. There are two things that can be done with an
                        item, either recycle it(or delete)
                        or mark it as done. If it is marked as done it will be moved to another list below the to-do
                        list with all the completed tasks.

                        Very simple app using a mix of Stateful and Stateless Widgets. Whenever the user presses a
                        button,
                        the answer is added to a list. Once the user answers all of the questions, the answers are
                        passed through
                        a switch case statement that constructs a sentence for the personality of the user. Once the
                        sentence is
                        constructed it is displayed on a new page and reveals the personality of the user. To find
